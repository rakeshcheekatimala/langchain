# Key Points
- The code uses LangChain's PromptTemplate to create a structured prompt.
- It utilizes the OpenAI Chat model through the ChatOpenAI class.
- The chain is created by piping the prompt template into the LLM model.
- The invoke method is used to run the chain with the provided input.

# Best Practices
- Using environment variables (load_dotenv) for sensitive information.
- Structuring prompts using PromptTemplate for clarity and reusability.
- Initializing the LLM model with appropriate parameters (temperature, model name).
- Using chaining to combine prompt templates with LLM models efficiently.
